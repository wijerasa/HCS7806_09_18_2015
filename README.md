#### *So far*,

1. *Overview of Next Generation Sequencing*
2. *Setting an iPlant account*
3. *Uploading data to iPlant*
4. *Intrdouction to iPlant Discovery Environment*
5. *QC and cleaning sequence data*
6. *Mapping of reads to the genome* 

#### *Today*,

1. *Introduction to iPlant Atmosphere*
2. *Introduction to Terminal*
3. *Doing down stream analysis in the Terminal*
